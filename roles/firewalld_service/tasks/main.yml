# Workaround: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51873965/check-that-only-one-of-several-ansible-variables-is-defined
# TODO: We also probably want a way to "reset" the firewall state to
# properly handle removing services. Is there a way to start fresh
# every run then make that configuration runtime+permanent at the end?
